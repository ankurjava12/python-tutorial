Print Function :-
```
In Python, the print() function is used to display the specified content as output. It can be used to print strings, variables, numbers, and other data types to the console.

1. objects: One or more objects to print. You can pass multiple objects separated by commas.
2. sep: Separator between the objects. By default, it's a space character ' '.
3. end: String appended after the last value, by default it's a newline character '\n'.
```
Here's the basic syntax of the print() function:
```
print("Hello World!")
print("Uttar Pradesh", "New Delhi","Panjab","Rajsthan")

# Sep parameter
print("Uttar Pradesh", "New Delhi","Panjab","Rajsthan", sep = "/")
print("Uttar Pradesh", "New Delhi","Panjab","Rajsthan", sep = "-")

```
